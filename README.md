# Proteomic assessment of 24 incident outcomes in the UK Biobank PPP sample

Individual Cox PH analyses between 1,468 protein analytes and 23 diseases and death are performed, over a maximum of 15 years of electronic health data linkage for 47,600 individuals.

Next, ProteinScores for incident outcomes are trained and tested in subsets of the sample using elastic net Cox PH regression. ProteinScore value beyond a comprehensive set of 26 covariates is quantified.

## All code used for the analyses is documented in this repository

All code for the analyses is written in R.
